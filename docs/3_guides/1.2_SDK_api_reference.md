# Aligned SDK

## API Reference

### `submit`

Submits a proof to the batcher to be verified and returns an aligned verification data struct.

```rust
pub async fn submit(
    batcher_url: &str,
    network: Network,
    verification_data: &VerificationData,
    max_fee; U256,
    wallet: Wallet<SigningKey>,
    nonce: U256,
) -> Result<AlignedVerificationData, errors::SubmitError>
```

#### Arguments

- `batcher_url` - The url of the batcher to which the proof will be submitted.
- `network` - The network on which the proof will be submitted (`devnet | holesky-stage | holesky`)
- `verification_data` - The verification data for the proof.
- `max_fee` - The maximum fee that the submitter is willing to pay for the proof verification.
- `wallet` - The wallet used to sign the proof. Should be using correct chain id. See `get_chain_id`.
- `nonce` - The nonce of the submitter address. See `get_next_nonce`.

#### Returns

- `Result<AlignedVerificationData, SubmitError>` - An aligned verification data or an error.

#### Errors

- `MissingRequiredParameter` if the verification data vector is empty.
- `ProtocolVersionMismatch` if the version of the SDK is lower than the expected one.
- `UnexpectedBatcherResponse` if the batcher doesn't respond with the expected message.
- `SerializationError` if there is an error deserializing the message sent from the batcher.
- `WebSocketConnectionError` if there is an error connecting to the batcher.
- `WebSocketClosedUnexpectedlyError` if the connection with the batcher is closed unexpectedly.

```rust
pub async fn compute_max_fee(

#### Errors

- `EthereumProviderError` if there is an error in the connection with the RPC provider.
- `EthereumCallError` if there is an error in the Ethereum call.

## `fee_per_proof`

Returns the `fee_per_proof` based on the current gas price for a batch compromised of `num_proofs_per_batch` i.e. (1 / `num_proofs_per_batch`).

```rust
pub async fn fee_per_proof(
    eth_rpc_url: &str,
