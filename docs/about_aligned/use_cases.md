- New settlement layers (use Aligned + EigenDA) for Rollups and Intent based systems.
  
- P2P protocols based on SNARKs such as payment systems and social networks.
  
- Alternative L1s interoperable with Ethereum.
  
- Verifiable Machine Learning.
  
- Cheap verification and interoperability for Identity Protocols.
  
- ZK Oracles.
  
- New credential protocols such as zkTLS based systems.
  
- ZK Coprocessor.
  
- Encrypted Mempools using SNARKs to show the correctness of the encryption.
