This guide will walk you through the process of upgrading your Aligned  Operator to v0.9.2.

## Changes

### New Features

* fix: operator downtime by @MarcosNicolau in [#1073](https://github.com/yetanotherco/aligned_layer/pull/1073)
* fix: operator commands by @MarcosNicolau in [#1184](https://github.com/yetanotherco/aligned_layer/pull/1184)
* fix: operator resets channel when updating latest block file by @MarcosNicolau in [#1200](https://github.com/yetanotherco/aligned_layer/pull/1200)

## How to upgrade

### Step 1 - Update the configuration for your specific Operator

This version requires update the operator configuration file adding the following fields:

```yaml
## Operator Configurations
operator:
  last_processed_batch_filepath: '<path to a file to store the last processed batch>'
```

{% hint style="warning" %}

Make sure the directory where the file is stored exists and the operator has write permissions to it.

We suggest to use absolute paths to avoid ambiguity.

{% endhint %}

### Step 2 - Update the Operator

Inside the Aligned repository, run:

```bash
make update_operator
```

This will recreate the binaries. You can then proceed to restart the operator.

### Step 3 - Check the Operator Version

To see the operator version, run:

```bash
./operator/build/aligned-operator --version
```

This will display the current version of the operator binary.

```
Aligned Layer Node Operator version v0.9.2
```

### Step 4 - Restart the Operator

Restart the operator based on your system config
